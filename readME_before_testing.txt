I've committed at weird points, so please, run tests like this:

Test 3 on commit "end of chapter 4, cat not showing, no clue why"
Test 4 on commit "chapter 5, minus the exercise"
Test 5 on commit "cat is now showing, finished exercise 5"
Test 6 on commit "chapter 6 exercise complete"
Test 7 on commit "finished chapter 7"
Test 8 on commit "chapter 8 and exercise"
Test 9 on commit "chapter 9 finished"
Test 10 on commit "chapter 10 finished"

I got 105/117 on the tests we were provided with.

Thank you and I'm sorry about this!
